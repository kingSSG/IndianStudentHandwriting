# Indian Student Handwriting Dataset

This repository contains code for segmenting words from handwritten images. Users can upload an image, and the code will process it to extract individual words, saving each word as a separate file. This project is aimed at building a dataset specifically for Indian handwriting styles, which can be useful for OCR models and handwriting recognition research.

## Features

- **Automated Word Segmentation**: Extract words from handwritten images automatically.
- **Supports Indian Handwriting**: Focused on Indian student handwriting patterns.
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple images at once.
- **Dataset Creation**: Saves segmented words into separate files for dataset generation.

## Segmentation Process

The following images illustrate the segmentation process:
